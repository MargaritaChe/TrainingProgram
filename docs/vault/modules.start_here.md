# Getting started

The training program is heavily focused on C# and the .NET ecosystem with a minor emphasis on "Line of Business" (LOB) Applications.

Our goal in designing this training program is to make it as entertaining as possible and leverage the best resources the internet has to offer.

Microsoft has put together an excellent documentation site to get started with C#.

## First Steps

1. Before you continue please make sure you read the [[readme]] document
2. Quickly read through the "[Tour of C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)" section to get a high-level overview of the C# language (Don't worry if it doesn't mean a lot to you, yet.)

Don't skip this step. Find a piece of paper, and write down all the keywords you come across that mean absolutely nothing to you.

Once you have finished. Take a picture of the piece of paper and send it to us.

Congratulation! the very act of writing these words down on paper is a significant step towards preparing your brain to fill in the "knowledge blanks".

3. Complete the [turorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/)

Microsoft provides several options to complete the tutorials. Find the one that works best for you.

Write down the topics you struggle with the most. Send us a photo of what you wrote down. (If some topics seem really easy, you can skip them.)

4. The documentation has a whole section on [C# concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/features)

These are all the topics you need to become familiar with over the coming months. Bookmark these pages and refer to them when you are ready to learn these topics.

It may seem daunting at first... but don't worry... little-by-little all these topics will become familiar and clear.

If you have time, don't hesitate to flick through, and scan these pages quickly.

## Programming concepts

Our objective is to get to a stage where all the terms and concepts used in the following [Code Review Best Practices](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/05/code-review-best-practices.html) article make sense.

Again write down the words and concepts that don't mean a lot to you now.

## Design concepts

The hardest skill to acquire in computer programming is "design".

Very often developers want to rush in, and start coding. Resist the urge.

- First, take the time to really understand the problem. "A problem well-defined is a problem half solved" - John Dewey
- Second, design the solution
- Third, write the solution

You can't achieve good design without clarity. Never underestimate the importance of a well-defined problem.

As an aside, this is why naming things is so important! The words you choose to name things are a direct manifestation of your understanding of the problem. If your understanding is incomplete or incorrect, your design will be lacking and the end result will be a disaster.

It is also the reason why it is crucial to check the definition of the words you use with your colleagues and stakeholders. Strive for a clear and precise common language. Try and keep words as simple as possible but not at the expense of precision! (This is a lot harder than it seems.)

## Feedback

We believe feedback is fundamental to all experiential learning.

The best feedback mechanisms are the ones you are able to build yourself.

When it comes to programming the best feedback mechanism is "testing", this is the reason why you need to learn how to create your own tests as soon as possible, so you can take control of your own learning journey.

Tests have many advantages, some of which are:

- They provide clarity of purpose by forcing you to "start with the end in mind". i.e. they force you to explicitly state your objective upfront
- They provide immediate feedback on your progress, as you write and revise your code to reach your objective (i.e. pass the test)
- Tests, inherently force you to write decoupled code, providing clarity of design

There are some pitfalls to be aware of when writing tests, but we will deal with those later.

If anything, just remember, with the right feedback mechanism in place, it is much harder to fail.
