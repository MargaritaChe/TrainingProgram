# Introduction

We want to make this training program simple, effective and fun!

We also want it to be comprehensive and meaningful.

Our guiding principle, in designing and building this program, is to make it accessible and valuable for developers of all skill levels, especially to people with very little programming experience. We want to impart to them all the knowledge and skills they need to design, document and build their own powerful applications, within a relatively short period of time.

We will keep refining the program to continuously shorten this time frame.

Each person undertaking this training program (in full or in part) is therefore strongly encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions in order to keep improving it.

The best suggestions are the ones that simplify concepts and remove confusion. 

You have an implicit obligation to leave this training program in a better shape than how you found it. No pressure... :-)

# Principles

- Feedback is the most powerful learning mechanism when used properly
    - Understand the objective (Start with the end in mind)
    - Establish your current location with respect to the objective
        - Create a map and itinerary you think is the best way to get to the objective
    - Correct your itinerary as you move towards the objective
        - Take the time to reflect on your progress and revise your itinerary regularly, based on your maturing understanding and in light of new information
    - Learn to build effective feedback mechanism on your own
- The best way to learn something is to teach it to others
    - Build your own training modules on topics you are learning
    - You will learn a lot about how much you don't know. That is the point :-)
- The next best way to learn something is to experiment and wrestle with the concepts
    - The lessons are only there as a guide. Let your imagination and curiosity guide you
    - When it comes to programming, you are only limited by your imagination! (Incredible potential is at your finger tips. Learn how to harness it and you will be able to build "castles out of nothing" ;-) )
    - You need implementation skills and design skills. Never forget that it is the design skills that are the most important. You can't build a beautiful castle without a good blueprint.
- Take the time to really "understand" the purpose of a lesson rather than just trying to complete it as quickly as possible
    - Once you truly understand you will never forget

# Suggestions

- Don't hesitate to update the docs with links to good articles or videos you find online
    - Include a short summary about why you found it useful compared to others content you looked at

# Approach

The training program will be split into multiple "modules".
Each module will have multiple lessons.

A module typically focuses on one topic, however there are definitely cross-cutting concerns. (i.e. Mixins of other topics).

Each module should clearly state the main topic of focus.
Each lesson should:
- Clearly provide some context
    - Concise text
    - Diagrams and flow charts
- Clearly list the objective(s)
    - Learning outcomes
- Unit tests
- Performance tests (optional)
- Provide links to references (books, videos, articles)

The tests are meant to provide trainees with immediate feedback on their progress.

It is therefore important for trainees to quickly learn how to build their own unit tests in order to take control of their own learning journey.

As we mentioned before, the best way to learn a new topic is to start building a training module of your own and sharing it with others. Capture their feedback and keep improving it. As your module improves your own skills will naturally improve.

# Streams and competencies

We will be focusing on 4 streams:
- Design and Architecture
- Requirements and Testing
- Implementation
- DevOps

Competencies are:
- Level 1 - Unconscious incompetence: You don't know what you don't know. e.g. Technical words within a subject matter have no meaning to you whatsoever.
- Level 2 - Conscious incompetence: You become familiar enough with the subject matter to gain an understanding of what is important and what isn't, and star developing skills in the important areas.
- Level 3 - Conscious competence: Fully developed skills. You understand the subtleties and nuances of a subject matter and how they relate to each other
- Level 4 - Unconscious Competence: Subject matter expert with good intuition

Please be aware of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) during the level 2 development.

Paradoxically, the best instructors are the ones that are about to move from level 2 to level 3. (The lessons they learned during level 2 are still fresh in their mind.)

The fastest and best way to move through level 2 is to teach people in level 1 or people who are just a step behind you in level 2. (Yes there are sub-levels in each major level. Note, there is a subtlety between being a good instructor for others, and teaching to learn fast. Don't pretend to know more than you really do. Let others know you are only a step ahead of them to produce the right dynamics. Being able to teach within an environment of "learning collaboration" is the best possible outcome.)

People who start teaching early in their learning journey often remain great teachers even when they reach the end of level 4.

"The biggest effect on student learning occurs when teachers become learners of their own teaching, and when students become their own teachers" - John Hattie

This quote is the epitome of good feedback.
